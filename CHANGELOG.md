# Ceradon UxS Architect Changelog

## UxS Architect Web v1.3 — 2024-07-01
- Hardened the access gate copy and storage so demo codes are never exposed in the UI while persisting unlocks locally.
- Fixed catalog-backed dropdown loading with explicit failure banners and a minimal embedded fallback catalog.
- Added a live Platform Preview with required-part highlighting, domain visualization, and immediate performance indicators.
- Enforced required components before evaluation/export and introduced launch/recovery/threat metadata in MissionProject outputs.
- Aligned MissionProject exports with a canonical schema version badge and origin tool tagging while keeping offline operation intact.
